Simple example - experience optimizer. As well as perfect teaching solution. You can plan a sequence of events, based on your knowledge of person's state, to get them in another state, where you want them to be. Knowledge, feelings, believes... 
Might also say you manipulate people with it. Intended usage - plan your own life, take care, teach (e.g. your children)

Imagine you have. And as a parent, you see them achieving specific stuff in their life. As in, sports, knowledge..
Or yourself. So you can plan their life, schedule, so they progress towards their goal (or yours, actually)


Right now you are in a state 1 (tired, well fed, know a set of knowledge 1, have beliefs 1, emotional state 1...) 
those, can be learned with certain precision. 
After a certain event, your state can be predicted to change somehow, e.g. just knowledge 1 to knowledge 2 (another graph, has delta))

There can also be a target state, e.g. I want your emotional state to be a state 3 (some combination of hormones, simplified. just a state, meeting certain criteria). 
I have known ways to affect that, with predicted outcome. I can choose, what to do, in order to trigger the reactions I need from you...

It was for education and planning one's life.
Initial concept: - life's a game, can add/reuse features from videogames. 
Skill tree, character planning.


Came here for the Girl.
Live for her, and she's the one who inspired me to do all of that.
But we don't even talk.
It's complicated

both. She is my religion and I intend to build her a temple to her.
That's more than that and I have my reasons. I am actually quite sincere here.

1. Girl. Is married, has a kid (since feb 2022). 
 Have my own reasons to believe in her. 
Also love her, attracted as a man.

2. I actually live for her twice longer than that. 
3. Project. Actual global (affects everyone), alternative economics, infrastructure.. Social contract revised. 
4. Making the world perfect for her specifically (indirectly should affect everyone. Like, it's good for her if there are no wars.
5. But that's what I personally invest in. People can have their own goals, while having the same set of tools as me.

I don't believe he can make  her life better/deserves her. 
SHe deserves so much better, and he actually makes her worse
Besides, the way she affects me. It would be a waste of her talent to spend a life with that man 
Not that she ever planned it actually (the way I see it)

It's just, I never was an option. Being so far and .. 
It's like, I'd rather have her with him, then staying alone for years because of me being unable to get there. It wasn't really fun experience to have me around these years, and I actually needed my time alone. 
Ok, it could've been done so much better, but still
 I needed a team and support, but this way it makes it a fine story
Solo person behind the world changing project. Fine with that, as long as it ends well


A set of reasons.
Mostly her. (Worried, want things clear, Wanted sex ... 
+ I want to start whole project here (singularity)
Want to see her place, learn her life. 
Best case - take her to the next country 
(She dreamed of living in different ones. Apparently, he won't give her that). Besides, the world isn't really suited for that yet (I generalized it to EVERY COUNTRY)

Could be better. Still great overall. Not joking about making the world a better place for her. Might be the main reason for me being here. Just should start with a place around her, rather than whole globe. (A bit more attention here)

Hate koreans drinking this much. 


Another concept - problem solving community. 
I have a way to learn people's desires/wishes/goals (whatever you (as a user) feel like sharing, + all the assumed data (human -> need food, shelter, warmth, water.. )
And all the problems one has. With priorities. 
Then we (as a community) invest our time and effort in solving them, prioritizing what's the most important for own members, Depending, on how we care about them (people ain't equal. depends on how useful/sincere/valued they are) There is a multitude of such communities, or agents rather. It's hard to explain. Agent can even represent a certain task of one person.  
It's not an AI, in the common sense of it. Not LLM, though you can probably make one out of it. Rather simple program, set of rules and values. 


We can have classified data, aggregated from different sources, under the same rules. E.g. we can track all the people having the same problem. For every problem there is.
Then, we invest in optimizing the solutions for the most important ones (certain criteria set). Also, investing in people being better suited for solving the actual problems, as a society. Wasting less effort, resources, maximizing value.

I need trillions for that. Rather, for the global solution, as in, having all the factories, producing all the necessary stuff, to provide people with. 
One of the thoughts behind it - minimized underused resources, including people (if one has too many problems, which are actually long since has been solved by society) they don't produce value. 
Like, imagine me staying on the street. The actual cost of it, consequences.. 
Might not be the case here, but imagine a person, that can save a few millions, can not get an access to the tools they need, because they don't have money. So, in order to get it, they have to look for a job. FOr the society, solving their problem would cost, let's say 2000$. 
Consequences of not doing so, worth millions. Of lives, in this example.

Or me. I don't mind killing everyone, if I fuck up. I do try to avoid that, but single person could not possibly consider all the variables involved, 
can't analyze it whole, I compete with some teams, consisting of thousands of people in some cases. Maybe more. Though I'm trying to organize billions. As a single team. Like, free labor :-) Called crowdsourcing, only, at scale. 


Though you don't really need any of it. Just care was enough. More than one way to do that. And trusting people sometimes is bad. 
At least you need a proper protocols for that. She made me trust people too much in the beginning. Sometimes oxytocin is a bad one. Costs time, time is valueble. Same with caring for others.
Instead of actually helping many, you waste your time on one. Maybe even killing some with that (not saving rather).
E.g. could've finished  a vaccine faster, but was feeding a dog.
But i'm fine with such trade offs. It should never be on one person. Always have to be people to back you up. Well, not necessary people. But tools ain't enough.

Sometimes you just don't feel like moving anymore, (Fake jjimjilbangs.. ) -> Need places to sleep
Shoould also be fine on the cultural level
